## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - React 18
  - TypeScript
  - CSS Modules
  - Webpack 5

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- pnpm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd e-commerce-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Development

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This will start the server with hot reloading at http://localhost:3000

2. Build the client bundle:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Watch mode for client bundle:
   ```bash
   pnpm build:watch
   ```

### Production

1. Build the production bundle:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting:** Separates vendor and application code
- **Lazy Loading:** Components load on demand
- **Compression:** Gzip compression for all static assets
- **Caching:** Aggressive caching for static assets
- **CSS Optimization:** CSS extraction and minification

## Authentication

The app uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. For development purposes, you can use these credentials:

- Username: admin
- Password: password

## API Integration

The app uses the FakeStore API for product data. In a production environment, you would replace this with your actual API endpoints.

## Development Notes

- The development server supports hot reloading
- TypeScript errors are shown in the console
- Webpack build errors are displayed in the browser
- CSS changes are immediately reflected
